### How this works

nixpkgs-tracker not same as [nixpk.gs/pr-tracker](https://nixpk.gs/pr-tracker),
it does not pass any requests through server to get PR status.

So, it's just a static page with some JS code to get PR status from GitHub API.

### Features

- [x] Show PR status
- [x] stable link (e.g. `nixpkgs-tracker.com/?pr=331928`)
- [ ] github token for more requests limit
