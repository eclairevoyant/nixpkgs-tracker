### How this works

nixpkgs-tracker not same as [nixpk.gs/pr-tracker](https://nixpk.gs/pr-tracker),
it does not pass any requests through server to get PR status.

So, it's just a static page with some JS code to get PR status from GitHub API.

### Features

- [x] Show PR status
- [x] Stable link (e.g. https://nixpkgs-tracker.ocfox.me/?pr=331928)
- [x] Github token for more requests limit
- [x] Click `Nixpkgs-Tracker` to switch light / dark
